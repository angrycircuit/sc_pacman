 hey guys this is Adonis, I could not figure out the graphics but while I was hunting around for examples but while I was hunting around I came across this gem. I've uploaded a file called pacman1.c and taken the liberty of designing the level based on the picture that Professor Lau had uploaded its about half of the map A,B and c building. anyways you can run it is VS 2019 and have a look. If we can learn something from it then I'm happy I could contribute.
